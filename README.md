**Crypto Trader** is a web application that automates cryptocurrency trading 
so you do not have to watch markets all day. Our mission is simple: 
democratize high‑frequency trading for everyone. We operate without taking a 
profit; paid tiers only cover compute costs so the value created stays with
you.

## ⭐️ What Crypto Trader is...
- A secure, hosted web app (no downloads required).
- Strategy‑driven automation you can turn on, pause, or change at any time.
- Clear safety guardrails so you remain in control of risk.

## 🧭 Plans and capabilities
- 🆓 Free — **Buy Low / Sell High**
  - A disciplined “buy low, sell high” algorithm with safeguards to avoid
    chasing volatility.
  - Proven in historical backtests to be profitable across common market
    conditions.
- 🧠 Pro — **Machine Learning Signals**
  - Models analyze large, diverse datasets to estimate multi‑term price 
    direction and confidence.
  - You choose risk parameters; the system sizes positions accordingly.
- 📰 Elite — **Multi‑Media Intelligence**
  - Combines price action with additional context (e.g., news sentiment) to
    inform entries and exits.
  - Built to seek the most robust strategies from multiple signal sources.
  - Access to Beast Mode compute tier for ultra‑fast trades.

## ⚡ Beast Mode, Elite Trades for Elite Members
Love Crypto? Then you'll love Beast Mode. Beast Mode is our premium compute 
tier for Elite members. Your strategies run on dedicated, high‑performance 
infrastructure tuned for ultra‑low latency and high‑throughput execution. 
Faster trades means better more opportunities for profitable contracts. 
High-compute means Deep Learning models can train and run much faster. Crypto
Trader wants to offer the best possible for all levels of trader interest, and
so, if you are a Beast Trader, try Beast Mode.

What you get:
- Priority execution queues for faster order placement during market spikes.
- Accelerated signal processing and model refresh on high‑core, 
  high‑RAM servers.
- Lower‑latency market data ingestion and routing paths.
- Automatic burst scaling under heavy load.

Who can use it:
- Available to Elite tier members. No extra setup required.

_Important:_ Past results and backtests do not guarantee future performance.
Always start in paper mode. Liability is your own.

## ✅ Why you should have it!
- **Time back**: the system watches markets 24/7 so you do not have to.
- **Simplicity**: pick a plan and a strategy instead of managing hundreds of toggles.
- **Confidence first**: backtest and paper trade before going live.
- **Control**: pause with one click; set limits for position size, loss, and exposure.
- **Privacy and safety**: your API keys are encrypted at rest; read‑only/paper modes are supported.
- **Fair model**: we do not take profit margins; higher tiers only pay for compute.

## 🚀 How it works (three quick steps)
1. Create your account — hosted, no downloads.
2. Connect your exchange or wallet (supports major exchanges; read‑only/paper mode available).
3. Choose a strategy and press Start. You can pause or adjust any time.

## 🔒 Safety, privacy, and control
- Keys and sensitive settings are encrypted at rest.

- Guardrails: stop‑loss, take‑profit, trailing protection, portfolio limits,
  and kill switches.
- See LICENSE.md for additional terms and responsibilities.
