**Crypto Trader** is a web application that automates cryptocurrency trading 
so you do not have to watch markets all day. Our mission is simple: 
democratize high‑frequency trading for everyone. We operate without taking a 
profit; paid tiers only cover compute costs so the value created stays with
you.

## ⭐️ What Crypto Trader is...
- A secure, hosted web app (no downloads required).
- Strategy‑driven automation you can turn on, pause, or change at any time.
- Clear safety guardrails so you remain in control of risk.

## 🧭 Plans and capabilities
- 🆓 Free — **Buy Low / Sell High**
  - A disciplined “buy low, sell high” algorithm with safeguards to avoid
    chasing volatility.
  - Proven in historical backtests to be profitable across common market
    conditions.
- 🧠 Pro — **Machine Learning Signals**
  - Models analyze large, diverse datasets to estimate multi‑term price 
    direction and confidence.
  - You choose risk parameters; the system sizes positions accordingly.
- 📰 Elite — **Multi‑Media Intelligence**
  - Combines price action with additional context (e.g., news sentiment) to
    inform entries and exits.
  - Built to seek the most robust strategies from multiple signal sources.

_Important:_ Past results and backtests do not guarantee future performance. 
Always start in paper mode. Liability is your own.

## ✅ Why you should have it!
- **Time back**: the system watches markets 24/7 so you do not have to.
- **Simplicity**: pick a plan and a strategy instead of managing hundreds of toggles.
- **Confidence first**: backtest and paper trade before going live.
- **Control**: pause with one click; set limits for position size, loss, and exposure.
- **Privacy and safety**: your API keys are encrypted at rest; read‑only/paper modes are supported.
- **Fair model**: we do not take profit margins; higher tiers only pay for compute.

## 🚀 How it works (three quick steps)
1. Create your account — hosted, no downloads.
2. Connect your exchange or wallet (supports major exchanges; read‑only/paper mode available).
3. Choose a strategy and press Start. You can pause or adjust any time.

## 🔒 Safety, privacy, and control
- Keys and sensitive settings are encrypted at rest.
- Paper mode lets you try everything safely before funding.
- Guardrails: stop‑loss, take‑profit, trailing protection, portfolio limits,
  and kill switches.
- See LICENSE.md for additional terms and responsibilities.
