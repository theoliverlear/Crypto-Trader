# Crypto Trader — Website Module
## The public face of Crypto Trader: brand, story, and a trading gateway

---

Crypto‑Trader‑Website is the marketing and information hub of the platform. It
tells the story, showcases capabilities, and guides visitors to the right 
place — whether that’s product overviews, plan comparisons, or deep technical
documentation.

Important: Past results and backtests do not guarantee future performance. 
Always start in paper mode. Liability is your own.
