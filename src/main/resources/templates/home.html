        <h3>Premium</h3>
        <p>
            At Crypto Trader, we believe everyone should access to an
            automatic trader. We offer that with our free tier. We also have
            options for those who want more. Our premium tier offers priority
            trading and faster trading software. A single asset's price is
            checked every 5 seconds in the free tier. In the premium tier,
            the price is checked every 1 second. This means that you can
            make trades faster, and that can mean more money. Our premium
            tier also offers priority which means that your trades are
            performed before the free tier. Instead of waiting in a queue
            behind other users, your trades jump to the front of the line.

            While premium users on average perform better than free users, we
            offer both tiers to cover the cost of running the application. We
            want to make sure that everyone has access to a trader, and so we
            offer a higher performing tier which supports both the premium
            user and the rest of our free users.
