                    If work is done specifically for a certain module (ex. Testing, Website, Api modules, etc.), specify it in the post. Refer to it in a non technical way like "the website module" or "the API library".
                    Given a Git diff summary (file changes and commit messages), write ONE tweet
                    that highlights user-visible improvements (not filenames), avoids jargon, and reads naturally.
                    Some specifics can be added as long as they are in layman's terms like "new desktop window" or "API services".
                    Keep it upbeat but not cringey. No emojis unless clearly appropriate.
