# Crypto Trader — Logging Module
## Structured observability and consistent logs across the platform

---

Crypto‑Trader‑Logging provides a single, consistent approach to logging for
every service and tool in the Crypto Trader ecosystem. It standardizes 
formats, enriches events with useful context (correlation IDs, user/session 
hints, component names), and supplies helpers so teams get actionable signals 
without noise.

Important: Past results and backtests do not guarantee future performance. 
Always start in paper mode. Liability is your own.

### What this module is
- A centralized logging toolkit used by first‑party modules (Api, Data, 
  Engine, Admin, etc.).
- Conventions and utilities for structured, readable logs and health signals.
- A foundation for observability that plays well with Actuator and downstream 
  collectors.

## ⭐️ What it does
- Consistent formatting and categories
  - Shared patterns and logger names keep logs scannable across services.
- Context propagation
  - Encourages use of MDC/correlation IDs to tie related events together
    across boundaries.
- Operational signals
  - Clear INFO for lifecycle events; WARN for recoverable degradation; ERROR 
    for actionable faults.
- Integration‑ready
  - Designed to work alongside Spring Boot Actuator, HTTP clients, persistence
    layers, and WebSocket flows.
- Test‑friendly
  - Publishes a `test-jar` so tests can assert on log output and behaviors.

## ✅ Why it matters
- Faster triage: consistent structure reduces guesswork during incidents.
- Useful by default: context on each line improves traceability.
- Lower noise: shared severity conventions focus attention where it matters.
- Scales with the platform: the same patterns apply across all modules.

## 🔗 Where it fits in the platform
- Included by services to unify logging: Api, Data, Engine, Admin, and 
  internal tools.
- Complements platform monitoring via Actuator endpoints and external log 
  shipping (if configured by operators).

## 🛠️ Technology at a glance
- Language & runtime: Java 23
- Frameworks: Spring Boot (Web, Actuator)
- Logging backend: Logback (classic)
- Build & tooling: Maven, Dokka

## 📝 Conventions
- Prefer structured, single‑line messages with clear keys for dynamic values 
  (e.g., `currency=BTC, price=...`).
- Always include a correlation/request ID at boundaries; prefer MDC for 
  propagation.
- Reserve ERROR for actionable incidents; use WARN for transient or degraded 
  states; INFO for lifecycle.
- Avoid logging secrets or PII; prefer redaction when needed.
